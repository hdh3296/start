Building an App (internal/SaaS)

By far the best ability of Claude Code is making web apps - whether that be internally to automate something or to sell as a SaaS - all you need is a simple setup.

My current setup (likely to change) is:

Python/Fast API for the backend

HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend

Redis for Caching (Using the Uptash MCP)

MYSQL for database (this is the game changer)

LangChain for AI Agents

OpenRouter for LLM

GitHub and Docker installed by Claude Code so it can handle all the dev work

Digital Ocean MCP to launch the site

DO NOT USE A FRAMEWORK

I am basically not using complicated frameworks anymore - I literally cannot be arsed with them. 

HTML/CSS/JS ranks on Google pretty well too:

This is all completely generated HTML/CSS/JS content created by taking my backend and making content around it. This is an EXTREMELY effective method of bringing customers in for free.

Redis for Caching
Redis is basically a way to cache things. The way that I do this is starting local. When it's time to launch, just ask the Redis MCP to create a live server for you to use. That's it. Redis is needed for certain tasks to learn it.

MYSQL/SQL Lite as DB
MYSQL is SO GOOD for databasing - MYSQL is fully integrated - and you can attach it directly to your server. All of the models etc for the database are already integrated into the code - you don't have to worry about any of it. This will be launched automatically alongside your code using Digital Ocean. This is a great system.

You can also use a hybrid system like the one I'm using, which uses SQL Lite to control Supabase - this allows you to have a Supabase for production and use SQL Lite + Migrations for dev and the database.

HTML/CSS/JS
You can build literally anything in HTML/CSS/JS you don't need any fancy frameworks at all - in fact I'd argue the page quality will only go up - not down, and you'll find yourself being able to make things way more easily than before.

Python/FastAPI
Everyone says use FastAPI and Python is one of the most well-known languages for AI to code in.

Langchain
You can unlock the power of Agents by asking Claude Code to do in-depth research on the above stack + LangChain. Specifically tell Claude Code to look up a lot of pages - and not just read one page of documentation. Also tell it to stick to official documentation only.

You can also make your own agentic system with Python. Claude Code knows how to do this. That's what I did - not necessarily intentionally but yeah. I used Pydantic for JSON validation and Claude Code made me an agentic system.

OpenRouter for LLM
I suggest using OpenRouter as it has the Search feature which allows you to very quickly and vey easily add the internet to LLMs - This allows you to do certain things that otherwise wouldn't be easy to do. Claude Code often invents an implementation of search with a fallback without telling you, so by giving it a complete system to do everything - you shouldn't have any issues.

GitHub + Docker
You don't have to UNDERSTAND what they are doing to use them. Basically GitHub is like when you used to play those games where you could save, so if you messed up the game, you can instantly revert back to that save. You can see the previous lesson on how to install GitHub + Docker so Claude Code can run its own commands. Docker is basically a dev environment that fits almost perfectly into a Digital Ocean environment, and makes things like changing Environment variables, handling different databases in production and dev, and other things - super super simple.

Basically, get Claude Code to be able to run Docker commands

Building the App
You can give the above information to your AI as a stack - I'm using Claude Code. Ask it to do in-depth research - Change the tech stack as you want below.

I want you to build around the following stack. Do in-depth research using the Bright Data MCP or just your internal web research tool - find out a complete implementation for all of the things mentioned above and create a technical implementation.md file - Python/Fast API for the backend

HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend

Redis for Caching (Using the Uptash MCP)

MYSQL/SQL Lite for database (this is the game changer) - Supabase for Prod

LangChain for AI Agents

OpenRouter for LLM

Please create me a simple system with a frontend which can be indexable by google, and a backend that can't. The frontend should only contain a quick homepage with a header for login as admin and login as user. From admin I should be able to generate access keys for people, and for a user login it should be an access code to login. Please make sure to think about security when designing this system.  The backend should have a clearly defining URL structure like /ai/dashboard or something and should not all be one route.

Start me a new GitHub repo and then launch this app onto a dev instance on Digital Ocean using the Digital Ocean MCP.

Make the entire system inside a Docker dev instance where you can run your own commands inside Docker to make fixes, make database migrations etc.

You can also a) use context7 MCP or b) allow it to do research itself c) give documentation links in Claude's memory.

Once it's finished the basic build above - run a /init command and it'll create a file that should allow you to code inside the same context and memory from now on.

Ensure to know the following flow:

Cd into your project after reopening the terminal

Run Claude --continue or Claude --resume

Run /memory and check the .md file to make sure it's up to date etc and you're inside the right Claude Code Context

Run /mcp to ensure your MCPs are still installed (see previous lesson for MCP commands)

Ask Claude Code to:

Pull from Dev branch - not always necessary as you may have dev branch already locally on your machine from your previous push

Start a new branch on GitHub

Make changes, develop new features

If you like the code Push to dev

If you don't like the code or something breaks and you want to return to dev, restore dev

Push to a new branch if they're experimental features that aren't stable enough to be the Dev branch

Go to sleep - Optional, you can also stay up all night and continue coding

Repeat from step 1, pull from either your last save branch, or from dev.

Rinse and repeat.

The beauty of this setup
The real beauty of this setup is Claude Code's ability to run diagnostic scripts and test scripts, and even fixing scripts - on everything. From Database, to Cache, to code itself. 

If there's an issue you can diagnose it programmatically most likely - meaning you can easily setup testing suites and other things that make it extremely easy to diagnose problems. This is a huge step up from the normal "here's my logs, here's my code, fix it" prompting that I normally do.
